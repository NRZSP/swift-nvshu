# Nvshu

## Introduction 🌸

Nüshu is a fascinating language that was developed and used exclusively by women in China. With its unique script, Nüshu served as a medium for women to express their thoughts, feelings, and solidarity in a time when formal education was inaccessible to them. Our project, "Nüshu," is a digital homage to this powerful form of communication. Through interactive tracing activities and gamified learning modules, this app aims to educate users about the Nüshu script and the profound stories and cultural significance that it carries. 📚👭
